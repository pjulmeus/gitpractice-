1) Man helps you learn all the flags and different thing you can run with each terminal command.
2) I got out of the man set up by pressing q to quit the command.
3) Option/Alt + left/right (jump between words)
4)Command/Control + e (move to end of line)
5) control + a
6) option + delete
7) A terminal refers to a wrapper program which runs a shell. The shell is the program which actually
processes commands and returns output.
8) Relative - cd Desktop - relative to where I am currently
9)Absolute- cd /Users/colt/Desktop - absolute, starting from the root (first /, then Users, then
colt, then Desktop)
10) Flags can change and even enhance commands and are added using a - after the command. -a flag to list “all” files (including hidden files and folders). command to give us more information
about each file, we can pass in the -l flag.
11) -r remove directories and their contents recursively, -f  ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt.
